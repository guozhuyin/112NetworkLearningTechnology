## Midterm Project
First, I introduce the csv dataset. It is important to know the meaning of each column in the dataset, but the column index name only shows the short word of each column. So I used Chinese to explain the meaning and the type of each column. I will focus on what is the relationship between alcohol consumption and grades? <br>
The column ‘Alc’ represents the student’s weekly alcohol consumption, which is calculated by adding ‘Dalc’ (daily alcohol consumption) and ‘Walc’ (weekend alcohol consumption). The column ‘G1’, ‘G2’, and ‘G3’ represent the student’s grades in the first, second, and third period, respectively. <br>
To make the grades of every period test comparable, I transformed them into z-scores, which indicate how many standard deviations the grade is above or below the mean. This way, we can intuitively see the distribution of grades. <br>
Next, I will show the total number of students who drink alcohol per week. As you can see from the bar chart, most students drink 2 units of alcohol per week. The highest number of students who drink alcohol per week is 10. I think this shows that most students are normal and healthy. <br>
Then, it is use histograms to illustrate the distribution of grades for students with different weekly alcohol consumption levels. We can see that the distribution of grades for students with different weekly alcohol consumption levels is similar. They are all close to the normal distribution. This suggests that the test is fair and suitable for students. <br>
Finally, it is use the ‘df.corr()’ function to calculate the correlation coefficients between ‘Alc’ and ‘G1’, ‘G2’, and ‘G3’. The results show that the correlation between ‘Alc’ and ‘G1’, ‘G2’, and ‘G3’ is low, ranging from -0.19 to -0.2. But normally, if Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient at least higher than 0.5, it means that there is a strong linear relationship between two variables. This means that there is no strong linear relationship between alcohol consumption and grades. You can also see the scatter plots of the correlations between ‘Alc’ and ‘G1’, ‘G2’, and ‘G3’. The scatter plots show that there is no strong linear relationship between alcohol consumption and grades. <br>
